# Hey JavaScript - Make me a sandwich!

> A program, often referred to as source code or just code, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform.

Writing JavaScript code is not much different from making a sandwich.

Really!

You've made sandwiches before, right? Now imagine explaining how to make a sandwich to someone who has not ever done it before. (Also, they are not terribly bright, so you have to be very, very specific with your instructions). You break it down step by step, each next step building on the one before. "First you get out the bread. Then put two slices of bread on a plate. Now spread mustard on one of the slices of bread."

Easy, right? Well, the process for putting together a useful hunk of JavaScript to do cool things in the browser works pretty much the same way.

###  Let's Start With Functions

> A function is typically a named section of code that can be "called" by name, and the code inside it will run each time.

- A JavaScript function is a block of reuseable code
